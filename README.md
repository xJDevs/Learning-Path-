# 📚 Learning Path – My Coding Journey

Welcome to my **Learning Path repository**.  
This repo is a collection of all my learning projects, exercises, and experiments as I grow my skills in programming and technology. Each folder represents a different topic, course, or project I’ve worked on.

---

## 📂 Structure

- **100 Days of Code**  
  Small Python projects and exercises from the well-known challenge.  
  - Lesson 15: Coffee Machine (Python CLI project).  
  - Lesson 16: PrettyTable demo (formatting tabular data).

- **More coming soon...**  
  As I keep learning, I’ll keep uploading projects related to software development, data, and beyond.

---

## 🚀 Areas I’m Exploring
- Python (fundamentals, OOP, data structures).  
- CLI applications and automation.  
- Data formatting, visualization, and libraries.  
- Problem-solving through coding challenges.  
- Best practices for project organization and documentation.

## 🛠️ How to Run a Project

Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/xJDevs/learning-path.git
cd learning-path
```
Navigate into the folder you’re interested in and run the scripts.
If a project requires extra libraries, check for a requirements.txt inside that folder.

🌟 Goals
	•	Keep track of my progress and growth as a developer.
	•	Build a portfolio of projects showing what I’ve learned.
	•	Explore different areas of software development, from fundamentals to advanced topics.
	•	Share my journey and hopefully inspire others who are also learning.
