# 📘 Lesson 16 – Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## 📝 Concept Summary
- Procedural programming = program structured as a sequence of steps.  
- OOP = paradigm that models software as **objects** with **state (attributes)** and **behavior (methods)**, organized into **classes**.  
- Goals: encapsulation, reusability (inheritance), polymorphism, maintainability.

## ❓ Why OOP?
- **Encapsulation** → fewer bugs, state lives inside objects.  
- **Domain modeling** → objects resemble real-world entities.  
- **Reusability & Extensibility** → new behavior via inheritance/composition.  
- **Polymorphism** → same method name, different implementation.  
- **Testability** → easier to mock/test in isolation.  
- **Team scalability** → clear APIs, fewer conflicts.  

> ⚡ Shines in: large systems, UIs, business rules.  
> ⚠️ Not ideal for: very small scripts or linear flows.

- **Attributes**: height, age

This project (main.py) is part of my learning journey. The classes (Menu, CoffeeMaker, MoneyMachine, etc.) were provided by the Udemy course instructor. My role was to put the pieces together. I struggled at the beginning because OOP was new to me, but after giving it some thought, it became easier than I expected. I'm still learning and reflecting on the experience.
